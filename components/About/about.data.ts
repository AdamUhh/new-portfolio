> Bio
Hello, I'm Adam. I enjoy building web apps and software apps.

> Interests & Hobbies
I spend my time on 3D printing, reading, and drawing. I like work that teaches me something new, like taking over challenging tasks, or things someone would hesitate to wanna try. I just wanna learn.

> What it's like to work with me
People have described me as a stoic. I stay focused on the work and handle whatever a project requires, though I do tend to drift off when the work becomes monotonous and I'm just sitting. Deadlines aren't something I enjoy, I doubt anyone does, but I understand them.
